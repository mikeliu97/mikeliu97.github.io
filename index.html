          <p>Hi, I'm Mike.</p>
          <p>I am a junior majoring in multimedia journalism at Virginia Tech. I am from Farmville, which is a really small town near Richmond, Virginia.</p>
          <p>I am a huge news junkie. I am constantly reading different news articles, because I love staying informed.</p>
          <p>I am currently the news editor for the Collegiate Times, which is a student-run newspaper at Virginia Tech. I have been with the CT for almost three years now, and I love every second of it.</p>
          <p>I have great writing skill and communication skill. I included some of the multimedia projects I did in the past. Please feel free to look around. If you have any questions, please contact me at zelia97@vt.edu.</p>
